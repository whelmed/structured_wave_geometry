# From Medium to Structure: An Introduction to SWG/SCG

---

## The still medium

Begin with a still medium. Not empty, but waiting. Compressible, elastic, able to ripple when disturbed.

A nudge sends motion through it. A wave appears. Most pass and fade. But some discover balance with the medium and become **stable waveforms**.

---

## The loop form

The simplest stable structure is the **loop form**.

Picture a piston moving up and down — that’s amplitude. Now attach a rotating fin — that’s phase. Together, they create a rhythmic cycle:

* **Amplitude** drives motion in and out.
* **Phase** gives it a twist, winding the cycle back on itself.

Because the piston and fin never fall out of step, the loop becomes **self-reinforcing**:

* It ripples waves evenly outward.
* Its rotation keeps the rhythm closed, preventing decay.
* The surrounding medium is continuously compressed and stretched, helping the loop persist.

A loop is the **seed atom** of SWG space.

## Pairing loops

Two loops can join. Their ripples interact — pushing, pulling, adjusting. Pairs can hold briefly, but they are not maximally stable. Without balance from another partner, they tend to drift apart or collapse.

---

## The triad: first true stability

With three loops, something new happens. Their rotations lock in a way that distributes strain evenly.

* If all three rotated the same way, the system would topple.
* But if two rotate “up” and one “down” — **UUD** — balance returns.
* Or if two rotate “down” and one “up” — **DDU** — the same balance holds.

These two arrangements are the **first maximally stable triads** in SWG space. Each loop reinforces the others, the whole stronger than the sum of its parts.

Where a lone loop flickers and a pair falters, a triad endures.

## Building up

From triads, larger motifs appear:

* **Chains** of linked triads, passing coherence along.
* **Rings** where curvature closes on itself, forming circuits.
* **Spirals and lattices**, recurring patterns that echo across scales.

The principle is always the same: stable forms ripple outward, their combined waves sync into new fixed patterns, and those patterns themselves become the building blocks for higher-order structures.

## Making coherence visible

Once these forms exist, how do we see them?

This is the role of **SCG**: it reads the **curvature of the medium** around the forms. Stable loops and triads show up as smooth, coherent geometry; instability appears as fractures and spikes. Through SCG, we can measure coherence, alignment, entropy, and flux — a dashboard of stability.

✨ From the **loop atom**, to the **triad core**, to motifs and beyond, SWG shows how stable forms arise in a deterministic medium. SCG makes those forms visible and measurable. Together, they provide a universal framework for modeling systems.
