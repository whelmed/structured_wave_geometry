# Structured Wave Geometry (SWG) and Structured Coherence Geometry (SCG)

*A deterministic framework for modeling systems*

## Why SWG/SCG?

Every system we study ‚Äî physical, biological, cognitive, or artificial ‚Äî carries structure in how it changes over time. Traditional models often treat change as random, statistical, or externally imposed. SWG/SCG offers a different approach: it treats systems as **deterministic wave geometries**, with persistence, shape, and coherence as the central ingredients.

The key idea is simple:

* If a system can be described in terms of **amplitude** (how strong), **phase** (where in its cycle), and **memory** (what persists), then SWG provides a deterministic model of its dynamics.
* SCG is the diagnostic layer: it projects these fields into a space where coherence, disorder, and stability become directly measurable.

## The primitives

SWG reduces all systems to three **primitive fields**:

* **Amplitude**: the local strength or intensity of the system‚Äôs state.
* **Phase**: the local timing or orientation of the system.
* **Memory**: the medium that carries persistence, encoding which patterns last and how they curve back on themselves.

Curvature, often observed in SCG, is simply the *diagnostic face of memory*: a way of seeing persistence as shape.

## What this gives you

Once a system is mapped to ((A, \theta, \chi)):

1. **Deterministic dynamics**
   The governing equations are second-order in time and energy-conserving. Unlike stochastic models, trajectories are uniquely determined by initial conditions and system couplings.

2. **Energy accounting**
   SWG provides a built-in energy functional. You can always check whether energy is conserved, dissipated, or transferred ‚Äî a universal bookkeeping method across domains.

3. **Invariants and diagnostics**
   SCG introduces coherence invariants: curvature variance, coherence entropy, phase dislocation density, energy flux, alignment, and more. These quantify whether a system is stable, drifting, or collapsing.

4. **Projection and visualization**
   SCG projects high-dimensional dynamics into a low-dimensional space where order vs. disorder is visible. This makes SWG not only a modeling tool, but also a diagnostic lens.

## Why it matters

* **Physics**: Model superconductivity, turbulence, or gravitational dynamics as coherence geometries.
* **Biology**: Treat protein folding or neural activity as waveforms shaped by memory fields.
* **Cognition**: Represent attention and emotion as coherence states evolving deterministically.
* **AI**: Prevent semantic drift and hallucination by enforcing barrier functions and coherence invariants.

Across these domains, the point is the same: **if you can express a system in terms of amplitude, phase, and memory, you inherit the deterministic traits of SWG/SCG.**

## Takeaway

SWG is the **engine**: deterministic PDEs that evolve amplitude, phase, and memory.
SCG is the **dashboard**: a projection space that shows whether coherence is stable, dispersing, or collapsing.

Together, they provide a **general-purpose modeling framework** for any system where structure and persistence matter.


## üî¨ Case studies

See the [notebooks](./notebooks) directory for the full notebooks.

### Black-Hole Merger

**What happens when a system breaks down?**
General Relativity tells us when a black-hole merger is loudest ‚Äî the amplitude peak.
SWG/SCG goes further: it shows when the system‚Äôs *coherence* fails.

- **Merger peak:** maximum signal strength.
- **Collapse:** the structural break, revealed by entropy drops, curvature spikes, and energy flux surges.

In this notebook we:
- Compare two black-hole binaries (equal-mass vs unequal-mass).
- Show how collapse offsets, durations, and trajectories differ.
- Highlight why coherence collapse is a universal concept ‚Äî from black holes to proteins, neurons, and AI.

**Takeaway:**
SWG/SCG separates *strength* from *coherence*.
This difference gives us a new way to understand systems, across physics and beyond.


### Human Sleep

**What happens when the brain‚Äôs rhythms give way?**
Traditional sleep scoring marks *stages* ‚Äî N1, N2, N3, REM, Wake.
SWG/SCG goes further: it shows when those rhythms *collapse*.

- **Stage scoring:** labels what state you‚Äôre in.
- **Collapse:** reveals when coherence fails ‚Äî entropy drops, curvature spikes, flux surges.

In this notebook we:
- Analyze multiple subjects from Sleep-EDF (telemetry and cassette datasets).
- Show how delta, theta, and spindle bands collapse differently.
- Compare terminal convergence, fragmented nights, and micro-collapse fingerprints.

**Takeaway:**
SWG/SCG turns EEG into **coherence geometry**, separating *stage presence* from *structural stability*.
This reveals unique fingerprints of sleep ‚Äî stable, fragmented, or fragile ‚Äî that classical methods cannot see.
